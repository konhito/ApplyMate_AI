## **Introduction**

**ApplyMate AI** is a powerful browser extension that automates the job and internship application process by interacting with websites and filling out forms. The extension connects to a backend system using polling, manipulates the DOM to highlight clickable elements, and sends curated prompts as images to AI for accurate form filling. Designed for users who are looking to streamline their job and internship applications, this tool automates the tedious work of submitting applications across multiple platforms.

-  **Customizable Prompts:** Uses context from the user’s resume and pre-configured data to tailor cover letters and personal information for each application.

## **How It Works**

### **Backend & Extension Interaction**

- The extension communicates with the backend through a polling mechanism to ensure it can detect changes in the webpage DOM.
- Once a webpage with eligible job/internship forms is detected, the extension highlights clickable elements and numbers them to guide the AI in filling them out accurately.
- It takes screenshots or images of the highlighted elements and sends them to the AI with a curated prompt, based on the user’s resume data.
- The AI processes the input, fills out the form, and submits it automatically.
